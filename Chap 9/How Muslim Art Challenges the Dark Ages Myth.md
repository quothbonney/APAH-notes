**Related to:** [[Islamic Art]]

The work of Islamic artists is deeply varied in theme, appearance, and style, but relies fundamentally on rigid principles of mathematics in conjunction with characteristic Islamic patterns such as calligraphy and tessellation. An early example of this is the Dome of the Rock, in Jerusalem. As Islam spread at unprecedented rates following the death of its prophet, the Dome of the Rock remains the earliest masterpiece of Islamic sacred architecture. Unlike other notable Islamic buildings, it is not a mosque; it is, instead, a shrine for the holy rocks upon which the Muslim religion formed. Among other events, the site was the location of King Solomon's first temple of Judaism, destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. In addition, it is believed that the Ark of the Covenant lies somewhere underneath, so is the site in which Abraham nearly scarified Isaac, and Muhammad first ascended to heaven
