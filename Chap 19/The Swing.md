### Form and Content
- Content
	- Unbelievably rich garden
	- Wealthy woman is swinging on a velt seat
	- She is pushed by an older man behind the tree
	- Her shoe is being kicked off by the momentum
	- Marble statue
	- Suitor admires the woman above him
		- Erotic connotations?
- Ultimately a painting of a royal courtison admiring his mistress
- Obviously aristocratic status
- Rather small work
- Very hedonistic work, "juicy" for the day
- Extremely intricate yet inviting nature scenes
	- My own interpretation: Kind of a mystical scene, draws the viewer in, really astonishing. 
	- Kind of combines mythical and real elements. 
	- Clearly the tree isn't something you would see, but the people are. It has a very interesting effect
- Kicked slipper leads to the marble statue of cupid, also represnting intense love and eroticisim
- Cupid has finger on lips (clandestine love?)
- Opposite hand grabbing an arrow of love
	- Young man (suitor) is infatuated by Cupid's arrow at the base of the statue
- Flowery dress of the woman is rose-like, unfolds sensuously
- Flower dress puts her in the world of nature itself 
  (theories->fertility)
- Older man pushing her believed to be her husband
	- Husband is unaware of her suitor watching her, and his wife allowing him
	- Ropes that the husband holds represents the shackles of marriage and taming
	- Lots of symbols of taming nature makes it a prevalent theme
	- Dog at husband's feet represents infidelity of the wife
- Triangle shape of the three characteres
	- Very common composition element
  

### Context & Interpretation
- Replica engraving was completed later
- Part of a trend going away from larger landscapes and portraits and more towards intimate artwork
- Paintings were for personal contemplation and decoration
- Swinging represents a common activity among wealthy women
	- Artists liked to depict it for its motion and complex scenes
	- Fragonard has multiple similar paintings representing aristocratic leisure
	- This particular painting is based on a very similar painting of a Seesaw
- Seesaw and swings led to floating dresses, an idea of eroticism was obvious
	- The formal nature of this time was often relaxed for these circumstances though
- Garden parks were a social element during this time
	- Young couples could sneak away into the complex gardens
	- French nobles enjoyed subverting the standards of royal life
- Part of ideas in Rococo about reflect humor and visual games in art
- Common imagery of cupid and dogs

### Patron & Audience
- A royal courtison in France. Painting supposedly depicts him and his mistress

### Purpose/Intent/Function/Theory
- Trellises on plants reflects intent to control nature, but it is overgrown, representing unconstrained love
- Woman's raised leg represents youthful sexuality (obvious reasons)
- Rejection of traditional female modesty
- Flirtatious act, kicking off her shoe
- Dress represents fertility, recognizes her as being part of the garden
