## Etruscan Architecture
- Most Etruscan architecture comes from tombs
- Arranged in densely packed *necropoli*
- Inspired by Greek buildings with pediments and columns
- **Made of wood and mud brick** not stone
- Sculptures placed on rooftops
- Flight of stairs leading to the entrance, not the whole building (like in Greek)
