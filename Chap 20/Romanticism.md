## Historical Background
- French Revolution created some level of freedom in France and Europe
- As well as North and South America (American Revolution and south American revolutions)
- Although the French Revolution wasn't strictly a good thing, it had postive effects on art and life
- Romantic art derives from freedom of individual thought and self-expression, created by the revolution
- People turned against the cynicism of the Enlightenment

## Artistic Life
- Ideas of a troubled genius still persists to modern day
	- Exhausted, tempermental (also seen in music history)
	- Reflects on bigger ideals than day to day ilfe
		- Beauty, brevity of life, etc...
- Spirit of adventure or refinement
- Political paintings, human worthlessness in perspective to life
- Development of photography
	- Not originally seen as art
- A lot of melancholy artwork and emotions depicted

## Revival Architecture
- Revival of EVERYTHING
- Interest in history and historiography
- "Yearing for past ideals" (Barron)
- Romantic anti-industrialism yearned for Medieval ideas
- Nostalgia for middle ages, islamic art, baroque art
- Washington DC architecture is romantic homage to baroque style
- Washington monument is an egyptian obelisk
- Ironwork has a golden age with new factory techniques

## Romantic Painting
- Attempts to capture the *sublime*
- Strictly AGAINST the enlightenment
	- Dislike of the ideas of order, symmetry, and logic
	- Instead focusing on the heart and emotions
- Renderings of the strange, haunted, insane, extraordinary, sublime...
- Interest in photography growing
	- Romantic artist's themes distanced them from photography
	- Still used photographs as a tool
		- Instead of hiring a model, you could use a photograph
  - Political paintings
	  - Goya, Delacroix all focused on dramatic political paintings with romantic ideals
	  - My own interpretation: Delacroix has a revivalist take, while Goya focuses very strongly on the emotions and feelings of his events

## The Development of Photography
- Coincided with developments in photosensitive paper
- Advancements of Camera Obscura technology
- Two types of photography
	- English
		- Lest costly to make, copyable
	- French
		- Had more detail, Dageurrotype
- Eventually exposures became shorter, allowing for human photography, along with portable cameras
