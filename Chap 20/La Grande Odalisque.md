### Form and Content
- Image of woman in a Muslim harem

- Women in harems were not prostitutes, but instead a house thing
- Image instead reflects western sexual fantasy
- Perfect brushstrokes
- Content
	- Naked woman, faced completely away from us
	- Head turns to face the viewer coy-ly, and distantly
	- Represents unavailability of the body, despite the vulnerability of the nude
- Context->distance: Figure distanced by exoticism, not by classicism!
- Arabia still seen as the distant, curious, and exotic
	- Although the ideas in the painting are not correct, it is still an insight into exotic interests
- Body proportions are not correct
	- Idealism? 
	- Not noticable, really
	- Obviously purposeful
- Jewels and pearls and fan in the image
	- Sensuality in royalty
- Leading lines mask over anatomical inaccuracies in the attempt to have a broader, more convincing image

### Context & Interpretation
- Looked back at the Renaissance tradition of nude Venuses
- Artists continued to use Venus as a subject of a nude, although they weren't culturally forced to anymore (like Titian was)
- Distanced nude figure, often classicized
- Artist was a student of David
	- Explains impeccable brushstrokes
- Takes neoclassical tradition to the limit
- Really a painting about unavailability
- **Bridge between neoclassical and romantic**
