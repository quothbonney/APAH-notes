### Context & Interpretation
- Gaugin turned to a painter after his white-collar career failed in France
- Sailed to Polynesia seeking a less sophisticated existence
- Painter attempted suicide after the completion of the work, because he believed it was his finest
	- Completed quickly, however
 - Gaugin believed he had completed a gospel of a painting (artistically equivalent to the true gospels)
 - All figures have symbolic meaning within the painting, answers the questions asked in the title
 - Symbols ultimately come together to form a unified philosophy by the painting
	 - As far as I know it is the first/best example of painting as  literal philosophy!
