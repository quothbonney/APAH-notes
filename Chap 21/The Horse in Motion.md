### Form and Content
- Black and white images of a horse galloping and stationary
- 1/1000 of a second aperture speed, amazing for its time
- Captures reality for scientific exploration
- Muybridge adds a seperate concluding image
	- Horse stopped at the end of the tripwire
- Zoopraxis-cope used to photograph
- Row of cameras work in sequence

### Context & Interpretation
- Arose out of a question from the founder of Stanford University as to whether horses ever have all four legs in midair
- Artist Muybridge had to develop the technology to do this
- Settled the debate: horses do have all four legs in midair at once with the legs together
	- Made signifigant inventions for capturing motion
	- Dispeled the "flying gallop" pose that was with all legs extended and in midair
- Muybridge also notable for photographs of the Yosemite valley
	- Also killed his wife's lover. So that is interesting I guess.
