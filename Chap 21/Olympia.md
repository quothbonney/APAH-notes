### Identification
- **Artist** Edouard Manet 
- **Name** Olympia
- **Years** 1863
- **Material** Oil on canvas
- **Location** Paris

### Form and Content
- Sharp color contrast
	- Emphasizes figure
- Unidealized nude
	- Asymmetry and imperfect forms
- Black maid enters the room, racial contrast
- Olympia seems so cold and uncaring
- Sharp lines and "poor" shading (at least compared to contemporanious art)
- Olympia is static, Laure (black woman) is in motion
- 

### Context & Interpretation
- Drawing on ancient nudes
	- Almost an identical pose as Titian's Venus of Urbino
- Positioning in the bedroom with the maid challenged the classical notions of the nude portrait
	- Classical nudes were idealized
	- References to Venus ^
	- Glorification of female form
	- This rendering is not classical whatsoever and does not attempt to be
		- Use of the black maid further emphasizes the reality of this portrait
	- Breaks away from perfect brushstrokes and atmospheric perspective of Academic Art
	- Line usage and lack of smoothness reminds me of [[The Stonebreakers]]
- Breaks the formulaic tradition of Academic Art
- Is clearly a real person (not venus)
	- Asymmetric face
	- Unhappy appearance (not ecstacy, or coyness)
	- Confronts the viewer in a human way
	- Olympia was a common name for sex workers
		- Also references Mt. Olympus? (my own interpretation), links the two ideas of classical and modern?
- Forces viewers to confront sexuality
- Idea that she is looking at an actual viewer (startled cat)
- The black woman had posed for Manet before, reused in this painting
	- Supports diversity
- Early non-exotic or ethnographic view of a black woman

### Patron & Audience
- Viewed terribly by art critics
- Reflects ==Caricature== lithograph
- Flat shading around the most 

### Purpose/Intent/Function/Theory
- Possibly supports inclusivitiy in a diverse Paris
- Painted during a time that black communities were growing in Paris
