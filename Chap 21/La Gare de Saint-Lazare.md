### Form and Content
- Ultimately a representation of a modern subject
- Canvas is so full of color and paintstrokes, that it jumps out at the viewer
- Rich texture with paint
- Extreme attention of light passed through the steam of the smoke
- Forms of the trains are highly atmospheric
	- When you zoom in on the train you can't even tell its a train, but it makes sense from a distance-
- Painting doesn't attempt to be "factual" instead focuses on impressions through color and form
- "Subjective experience" (interesting description)
- Monet not concerned with the human figure in this painting
- A beauty more consistent with technology and modernity
- No atmospheric perspective
