## Saint Matthew
- Identified by his name in weird Greek letters
- Accompanied by his symbol of the winged man
- Depicted writing the manuscript of god
- Seen in perspective (although poor)
- Traditional pose
- Kind of flat (but intentionally)

## Cross Carpet Page
- Prefaced the cover of a gospel
- This one is for Matthew's gospel
- Highly abstract other than the overarching cross and animal heads
- Weaving imagery called Hiberno-Saxon
	- Influenced by similar work from this area that incorporated knots and abstract patterns
- Integration of Roman traditions
